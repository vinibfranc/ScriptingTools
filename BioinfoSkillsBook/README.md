## Chapter 1 -  How to Learn Bioinformatics

1. Biology’s Growing Data
2. New Challenges for Reproducible and Robust Research
    - Reproducibility
    - Sharing data
    - Analyses can lead to findings being susceptible to errors and technical confounding
3. Reproducible Research
4. Robust Research and the Golden Rule of Bioinformatics
    - In wetlab biology, when experiments fail, it can be very apparent, but this is not always true in computing
    - Genomics data also creates its own challenges for robust research. First, most bioinformatics analyses produce intermediate output that is too large and high dimensional to inspect or easily visualize
5. Genomics data also creates its own challenges for robust research. First, most bioinformatics analyses produce intermediate output that is too large and high dimensional to inspect or easily visualize
    - Need to rerun analyses
    - Revisit parts of a project
6. Recommendations for Robust Research
    - Pay Attention to Experimental Design
    - Write Code for Humans, Write Data for Computers
    - Let Your Computer Do the Work For You
    - Make Assertions and Be Loud, in Code and in Your Methods
    - Test Code, or Better Yet, Let Code Test Code
        - How many times is this code called by other code?
        - If this code were wrong how detrimental to the final results would it be?
        - How noticeable would an error be if one occurred?
    - Use Existing Libraries Whenever Possible
    - Treat Data as Read-Only
    - Spend Time Developing Frequently Used Scripts into Tools
    - Let Data Prove That It’s High Quality
7. Recommendations for Reproducible Research
    - Release Your Code and Data
    - Document Everything
    - Make Figures and Statistics the Results of Scripts
    - Use Code as Documentation
    - Continually Improving Your Bioinformatics Data Skills
